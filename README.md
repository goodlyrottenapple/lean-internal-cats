# lean-tutorials

The goal of this project is to gather tutorials and demo files for Lean
beginners, allowing to see what it looks like without reading 
much documentation. Currently there is one such tutorial.

Of course you can look at [this file](src/first_proofs.lean) online but
the recommended way it to [install Lean](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/README.md) and [get this project](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/install/project.md) for local use.
